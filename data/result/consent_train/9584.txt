Prev Dialog Mention Context: [[['Brad Parscale', 'Brad Brad Parscale (born January 3, 1976) is an American digital media and political strategist. He served as the digital media director for Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign. Brad Parscale began working for the Trump Organization in 2011, developing and designing websites, and creating and managing digital media strategies. In early 2015, Trump hired Brad Parscale and his firm, Giles-Parscale, to create a website for his exploratory campaign. When Trump declared himself a Republican candidate in 2015, one of the first people he called was Parscale, asking him to update his exploratory campaign site into a "full-fledged presidential campaign website." Throughout the Republican primary, Brad Parscale was responsible for the Donald J. Trump for President website, as well as for digital media strategy and online fundraising campaigns. In June 2016, Brad Parscale was officially named digital media director for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign, overseeing all aspects of digital media and online fundraising, as well as traditional media strategy, like radio and television placements. In January 2017, Parscale, along with another senior Trump aide, Nick Ayers, formally launched America First Policies, a non-profit organization that promotes President Trump\'s agenda and White House initiatives.'], ['America First', 'America First refers to a foreign policy in the United States that emphasizes American nationalism in international relations and that is often described as isolationist. It first gained prominence in the interwar period and was advocated by the America First Committee, a non-interventionist pressure group against the American entry into World War II. Since 2016, an identically-named foreign policy that emphasizes similar objectives has been pursued by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.'], ['Nick Ayers', 'James Nicholas "Nick" Nick Ayers (born August 16, 1982) is an American political strategist who has been Chief of Staff to the Vice President Mike Pence since July 2017.

Prev Dialog Mention Context: [[['Brad Parscale', 'Brad Brad Parscale (born January 3, 1976) is an American digital media and political strategist. He served as the digital media director for Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign. Brad Parscale began working for the Trump Organization in 2011, developing and designing websites, and creating and managing digital media strategies. In early 2015, Trump hired Brad Parscale and his firm, Giles-Parscale, to create a website for his exploratory campaign. When Trump declared himself a Republican candidate in 2015, one of the first people he called was Parscale, asking him to update his exploratory campaign site into a "full-fledged presidential campaign website." Throughout the Republican primary, Brad Parscale was responsible for the Donald J. Trump for President website, as well as for digital media strategy and online fundraising campaigns. In June 2016, Brad Parscale was officially named digital media director for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign, overseeing all aspects of digital media and online fundraising, as well as traditional media strategy, like radio and television placements. In January 2017, Parscale, along with another senior Trump aide, Nick Ayers, formally launched America First Policies, a non-profit organization that promotes President Trump\'s agenda and White House initiatives.'], ['America First', 'America First refers to a foreign policy in the United States that emphasizes American nationalism in international relations and that is often described as isolationist.
