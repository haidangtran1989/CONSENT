Howell and Terry M. Moe described Robert\'s decision not to take a position on obstruction of justice for Trump—despite "compiling a mountain of incriminating evidence"—as something that "will surely go down as one of the strangest—and most consequential—moves in modern legal history."', 'Is Serg a spy?\nAccording to ABC News, former U.S. ambassadors and analysts contradicted with "strong skepticism" the claim that Sergey is a spy.']
