Prev Dialog Mention Context: [[['Pavel Gubarev', 'Pavel Yuryevich Pavel Gubarev (, , ), born 10 February 1983 in Sievierodonetsk, is a Ukrainian pro-Russian activist who proclaimed himself the "People\'s Governor" of the Donetsk Region at the Regional Assembly on 3 March 2014, after separatists seized the building. Pavel Gubarev had earlier declared himself leader of the Donbass People\'s Militia. But since then he has been sidelined by other separatist leaders and was banned from taking part in the 2014 Donbass parliamentary elections.

It has been recognized only by the partially recognized Republic of South Ossetia. It receives humanitarian and military backing from Russia. The Ukrainian government has designated it as a terrorist organization and it is at war with Ukraine, alongside the Luhansk People\'s Republic (LPR). It formed an unrecognized confederation of Novorossiya, referencing the corresponding historical region and its name with the also unrecognized LPR until its 20 May 2015 suspension, and since February 2015 has postured itself as the successor to the historic DonetskÃ¢  Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic. Along with the Luhansk People\'s Republic and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the Donetsk People\'s Republic is considered one of three temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine as a result of Russian military intervention of 2014.']]]
