Bob Corker worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal, and those are pretty factual."', 'Voted on what in March 2018?\nIn March 2018, Bob voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.', 'Who Sarah replaced in White House?\nOn July 21, 2017, after Spicer announced that he was going to resign, newly appointed White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci announced that Sarah would take the role of White House press secretary.', 'What did not say in press conference?\nIn an August 2018 press conference, Sarah was repeatedly asked by Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter, to say that the press was not the "enemy of the people", and she did not do so.', 'What did Chris call for action in the Senate?\nFollowing the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Chris made an impassioned call for action in the Senate stating that "this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting.']
