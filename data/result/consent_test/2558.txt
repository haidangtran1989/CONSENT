Although his arm was not overpowering, he had a quick release and made accurate throws, ultimately winning four Gold Glove awards. Trammell\'s defense perfectly complemented his double-play partner, Lou Whitaker. The two formed the longest continuous double-play combination in major league history, playing 19 seasons together. At the plate, Alan Trammell was one of the best-hitting shortstops of his era and won three Silver Slugger awards. Alan Trammell later served as Detroit\'s manager from 2003 through 2005. He also served as the interim manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks during the final three games of the 2014 season.']], [['Dave Dombrowski', 'David Dave Dombrowski (born July 27, 1956) is a professional baseball executive and is currently serving as the President of Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB).
