The preparatory is accredited by the Texas Education Agency and rated as an exemplary secondary by TEA standards. LTHS serves students in grades nine through twelve who live in southwest Travis County and is part of the Lake Travis Independent School District. LTHS and LTISD were both established in 1981 after splitting from the Dripping Springs Independent School District. The current high school was built in 1988. Because of major growth in the Austin Metropolitan Area, the high school has undergone several expansion projects. Due to the increase in student population, LTHS was reclassified in 2012 as a member of the UIL 5A conference.

Mayfield began his college football career as a walk-on player for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. He is notable for being the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start a season opener at a BCS school. Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma following alleged scholarship issues and a lack of communication with coaches. After sitting out the 2014 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Mayfield won the starting quarterback job in 2015 over Cody Thomas and incumbent starter Trevor Knight.']]]
