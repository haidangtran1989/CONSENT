In a parliamentary system, the head of state is usually a different person from the head of government. This is in contrast to a presidential system, where the head of state often is also the head of government and, most importantly, the executive branch does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.'], ['Sigmar Gabriel', 'Sigmar Gabriel (born 12 September 1959) is a German politician who has served as Minister for Foreign Affairs since 2017 and Vice Chancellor since 2013.
